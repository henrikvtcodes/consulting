## The Problem
Sean & Xavier, managers of the Dwarfskill Preserve Vacation rental, had a problem: While their property is a beautiful environment, guest still expect great wifi in this modern age. Occaisionally, guests were not able to access the WiFi. This was actually a tangible problem for them, as they would have to give guests a discount on their stay. We discussed this and realized two problems that needed solving. First, the wifi router was not of suitable capability to serve its purpose. Second, it did not have enough range to reach the other cabins.  
One of the solutions that was considered involved installing separate internet services for each of the three cabins. While this would fix the problem, it would also triple their internet bill.
## The Solution
I was able to come up with a solution that balanced cost and complexity.  
First, I installed a better Wifi router that is designed for more professional scenarios: The Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine. It has features that would fix some of our immediate problems: it has a professional grade access point and remote troubleshooting capability. This would fix wifi stability issues.  
Second, to solve the range issue, I installed a point-to-point radio link to the other cabins. Then, I installed an access point in each cabin. These were all tied together and provided maximum internet speed for all guests.
## The Results
After over a year of operation, Sean & Xavier have received no guest complaints about wifi performance and have not had to issue any discounts or refunds as a result. Whenever they had issues, I was able to remotely log in, troubleshoot, and resolve the issue at hand. They've been able to have multiple people across multiple buildings do network-intensive tasks like Zoom calls - at the same time!   
The system has also paid itself off in multiple ways by this point. Primarily, it has saved money in that they have not had to compensate guests due to wifi complaints.  It has also saved money over the long run when compared to other solutions.
